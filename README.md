# The Price is Right

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently the `calculateTotal` function is not implemented causing the tests to fail. Use what we've learned about mapping to properly implement this function such that the tests pass.

## Provided Files

**.eslintrc.js** - a config file for eslint

**.gitignore** - this file sets the project up to ignore the node_modules folder when committing to git

**package.json** - this file sets up the Node project including all the dev dependencies

**checkout.js** - this file contains the functions for calculating the total for a purchase based on item price, discounts and quantity

**tests.js** - this file contains tests for the functions in the `calculateTotal` function

## Exercise Submission

You should fork this repository and submit your working changes in a pull request to your forked repo.
